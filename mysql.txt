Select query:
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Customers;

SELECT DISTINCT Statement:
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM Customers;

SQL WHERE Clause:
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';->for text '' mostly sometimes ""
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID=1;->for number no quotes 
we can use select,update,delete with where class
operators used =,>,<,>=,<=,<>,!=,BETWEEN,LIKE,IN(similar to or)

ORDER BY Keyword

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order alphabetically
eg:SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName

SQL AND Operator-displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.
SQL OR Operator-displays a record if any the conditions are TRUE.
You can combine AND OR but use paranthesis
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');
Syntax:SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

SQL OR
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';
if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain


SQL NOT Operator:(NEGATIVE RESULT)

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
Eg:SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Spain';
can be used with like,between,in,greater than, lesser than

SQL INSERT INTO Statement (2 ways to insert)
1.INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
2.If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query
Syntax:INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);


SQL NULL Values:
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
How to Test for NULL Values?We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.
Syntax:SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
Syntax:SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.

SQL UPDATE Statement


SQL FUNCTIONS:
select length('keerthikA');->9
select length('keerthika\0');->10 \0 is will be considered as null (\0)=1 byte so 9+1=10
select upper('keer');
select lower('KEER');
select length(trim('  keer  '));
select trim('  keer  ');
select rtrim('  keer  ');
SELECT REPLACE('keerthika','ee','a'); -- strig,from_string,to_string
select substr('Keerthika Devi',9,3); -- string,start_position,length ->o/p:a D 
note:1 based indexing used
select empname,upper(empname) as up_empname from emptable;
SELECT UPPER(empname) AS up_empname FROM emptable;
select concat(firstname,'D',lastname)as name from student;
select right(name,3) from students; ->gives last 3 char of name column
select instr('Keerthika','th');->it will the position ;o/p:5
If not found return 0/NULL
select instr('Keerthika','z');->o/p:0
select reverse('Keerthika');
SELECT LPAD('123', 5, '0');->string,length,pad_string ;o/p:00123
SELECT RPAD('123', 5, '0');->string,length,pad_string ;o/p:12300
SELECT ABS(-900);->O/P:900
SELECT ROUND(34.6);->O/P:35
SELECT CEIL(34.4);->O/P:35
SELECT FLOOR(34.9);->O/P:34
SELECT MOD(23,3);->O/P:2
SELECT POWER(5,4);->O/P:625
SELECT SQRT(144);->O/P:12
SELECT SIGN(-90);->O/P:-1
SELECT SIGN(90);->O/P:1
SELECT SIGN(0);->O/P:0
SELECT TRUNCATE(67.896543,2);->O/P:67.89
SELECT TRUNCATE(RAND(),6)->Generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.
SELECT ROUND(RAND()*1000000);->FOR OTP GENERATION
SELECT NOW();
SELECT CURDATE();
SELECT DAYNAME('2025-11-18');
SELECT DAYNAME(CURDATE());
SELECT DATE(NOW());
SELECT TIME(NOW());
SELECT YEAR(NOW());
SELECT YEAR('2004-02-05');


SQL Aggregate Functions:op is always a single value
Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.
Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT(*)).
eg:
SaleID	Amount
1	100
2	NULL
3	200
4	300
5	NULL
SELECT COUNT(Amount) FROM Sales;->o/p:3
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Sales;->o/p:5

SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions:
SELECT MIN(Price) as smallprice
FROM Products;
SELECT MAX(Price) as largestprice
FROM Products;

Note:When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword
